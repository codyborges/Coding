      <span> Delicious shrimp mozambique in a bowl.</span>
    <p> I grew up eating Shrimp Mozambique.  And to eat Shrimp Mozambique is to love Shrimp Mozambique. In my family and in my little area of New England, Shrimp Mozambique is a mainstay.  We serve it every Christmas and several times throughout the year for different gatherings and parties.  Elegant in its presentation, exotic in its flavor and almost magical in its ability to transform a dinner into a party!  All this and you might think this is going to be a long drawn out and expensive recipe that is hard to understand and even harder to follow… but you would be all wrong on all counts.  In fact, Shrimp Mozambique is not only quick and easy, but pretty reasonable to make at home especially if you can pick up this size shrimp on sale for $6.99 for a 2 lb. bag like I did in the freezer section!

        </ul>

        <h4> Directions</h4>
        <p>In a medium pot, melt one stick of butter.  Add in onions, saute for about 5 minutes.  Add in garlic, saute an additional 5 minutes.  Add in a pinch of salt.  Add in Azafran, stir.

<li>Melt a stick of butter</li>
<li>Finely dice 1/2 a large onion or one whole medium onion.</li>
<li>Add onions into your melted butter… you will want to get these started before you add in the garlic as they have a longer cook time than garlic and the last thing you want is burnt garlic!</li>
<li>You will need about 6 cloves of garlic.Smash your garlic before mincing. <span>(it helps to release lots of the flavors on everyone.) </span></li>
<li>Mince garlic.</li>
<li>Once the onions have started to soften, add in your garlic.</li>
<li>You will need one packet of Sazon seasoning per pound and so in this case we are making two pounds, so we will need to add two packets.</li>
<li>Add in one heaping Tbs. crushed red pepper. (I think this photo is so cool… my pepper was in the fridge and the pot is really hot causing that white smoke you see around the pepper)</li>
<li> Add shrimp and stir to coat the shrimp with all the spices and color.</li>
<li>Add in one bottle of beer any run of the mill domestic will do. (If you are allergic to gluten, you could substitute about 1 1/2 cups of dry white wine or just a gluten-free beer)</li>
<li>Be sure the shrimp are coated. Add in a pinch of kosher salt.</li>
<li>Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, when it comes to a boil lower heat to a simmer and cook for 8-12 minutes and then immediately remove from heat.</li>
<li>There… perfectly cooked shrimp! Now, don’t forget to taste for salt, add another pinch if needed. Enjoy!</li>
