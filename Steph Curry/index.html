<span>Changed the game</span>
<li>In todays game the 3pt shot is the most sought after, most practiced shot since his arrival in the league.</li>
<li>Steph Currys' confidence in his ability to shoot 30 foot shots led to players like Damian Lillard doing the same, by working on these types of shots</li>
<li>In the early 2000's there were maybe 5-10 attemtped 3's per game per team. Now those attempts skyrockted to 20+.</li>
